### Overview

Project based on the counter builder from Scrimba. The course covered basic JS on creating a counter for people coming in and out of a train. 


## My process

For this process I went through the lesson on buidling the counter and then deleted everything and rebuilt it with just using the notes that I've created (see below). And to make it an extra challenge I decided to use my CSS skills to customize it and make it a little nicer and responsive.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow (attempted)

### What I learned

With Javascript taking a bit to click I learned a few things that I've learned and then learned some functions such as onclick for buttons (which is one I will likely be using a lot). I also realized that some things are just stupid easy and I tend to think a little *too critically which is something that will likely take some practice with writing vanilla Javscript. 

I also learned that it's so important to console.log every step to ensure you're avoiding bugs, especially as I'm learning Javascript. I remember when I was first learning I wasn't doing it and was just getting more confused on what I did wrong but now after each line I do it as good practice but it makes the project a lot more manageable.
